# Common Development Mistakes to Avoid

- **Ignoring Error Handling:** Failing to handle potential errors can lead to unexpected crashes and a poor user experience. Always anticipate and handle errors gracefully.
- **Writing Inefficient Database Queries:** Poorly written queries can be a major performance bottleneck. Profile and optimize your queries.
- **Not Using a Version Control System:** Failing to use a version control system like Git makes it difficult to collaborate, track changes, and revert to previous versions.
- **Hardcoding Configuration:** Avoid hardcoding configuration values like API keys, database credentials, and other environment-specific settings directly in your code. Use environment variables or configuration files.
- **Neglecting Security:** Overlooking security can expose your application to vulnerabilities. Be aware of common threats like SQL injection, XSS, and CSRF, and take steps to mitigate them.
- **Lack of Testing:** Insufficient testing can lead to bugs and regressions. Write unit, integration, and end-to-end tests to ensure your code is reliable.
- **Reinventing the Wheel:** Before building a new feature from scratch, check if there is a well-maintained library or framework that can do the job.
- **Poor Code Organization:** Disorganized code is hard to understand and maintain. Follow a consistent project structure and use clear naming conventions.
- **Not Documenting Code:** Lack of documentation makes it difficult for other developers (and your future self) to understand your code. Document complex logic and API endpoints.
