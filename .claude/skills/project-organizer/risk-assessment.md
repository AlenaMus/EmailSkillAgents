# Risk Assessment and Management

Risk management is the process of identifying, assessing, and controlling threats to a project's capital and earnings. These threats, or risks, could stem from a wide variety of sources, including financial uncertainty, legal liabilities, strategic management errors, accidents, and natural disasters.

## Risk Management Process

1.  **Identify Risks:** Brainstorm potential risks that could impact the project. This can be done with the project team and other stakeholders. Categorize risks (e.g., technical, resource, budget, schedule).
2.  **Analyze Risks:** Assess the likelihood and potential impact of each identified risk. A common way to do this is to use a risk matrix, which plots likelihood against impact on a low-to-high scale.
    - **Likelihood:** The probability of the risk occurring.
    - **Impact:** The effect the risk would have on the project if it occurred.
3.  **Prioritize Risks:** Prioritize risks based on their likelihood and impact. High-priority risks are those with a high likelihood and high impact.
4.  **Develop Risk Responses:** For each high-priority risk, develop a response plan. Common responses include:
    - **Avoid:** Eliminate the threat by changing the project plan.
    - **Mitigate:** Reduce the probability or impact of the risk.
    - **Transfer:** Shift the risk to a third party (e.g., through insurance).
    - **Accept:** Acknowledge the risk and do not take any action unless it occurs.
5.  **Monitor and Review Risks:** Regularly review existing risks and identify new ones. The risk management plan should be a living document that is updated throughout the project.

## Risk Register

A risk register is a tool used to document identified risks, their analysis, and the planned responses. It typically includes:
- A unique identifier for each risk.
- A description of the risk.
- The category of the risk.
- The likelihood and impact of the risk.
- The overall risk score (likelihood * impact).
- The planned response.
- The owner of the risk (the person responsible for monitoring it).
- The status of the risk.
