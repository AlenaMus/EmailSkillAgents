# Agile Methodologies

Agile is an iterative approach to project management and software development that helps teams deliver value to their customers faster and with fewer headaches.

## Scrum

Scrum is a framework that helps teams work together. It encourages teams to learn through experiences, self-organize while working on a problem, and reflect on their wins and losses to continuously improve.

- **Sprints:** Time-boxed iterations (usually 2-4 weeks) where a shippable increment of product is created.
- **Roles:** Product Owner, Scrum Master, Development Team.
- **Events:** Sprint Planning, Daily Scrums, Sprint Review, Sprint Retrospective.
- **Artifacts:** Product Backlog, Sprint Backlog, Increment.

## Kanban

Kanban is a visual method for managing workflow at the individual, team, and organizational levels. It is focused on visualizing the work, limiting work in progress, and maximizing flow.

- **Visualize Workflow:** Use a Kanban board with columns representing stages of the work.
- **Limit Work in Progress (WIP):** Set limits on the number of items that can be in any one column to prevent bottlenecks.
- **Manage Flow:** Measure and manage the flow of work through the system.
- **Continuous Improvement:** Use models and the scientific method to identify opportunities for improvement.
